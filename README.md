# Recipes project

## Description
This project is a solution to the Recipes project on The Odin Project website.
It contains an index page, where you can choose from three recipes: grilled
cheese sandwich, garlic bread and vodka martini cocktail. Clicking on either
will take you to its recipe page. There you can see a small description of the meal, an image of it, the ingredients list, and the required steps to prepare the meal.
